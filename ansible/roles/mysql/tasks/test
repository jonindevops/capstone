Bringing development, QA and Operations teams closer together is at the core of the DevOps transformation that is sweeping through IT organizations. Improved collaboration, cross-functional teams and shared understanding of the entire application lifecycle promise to help companies build more scalable, higher quality systems and deliver a better service to their customers.

“Get a system provisioning and configuration tool like Puppet or Chef” seems to be the current standard answer to the frequent question of how to get started, but of course there’s much more to “doing DevOps” than simply adopting the flavor-of-the-month tool. Creating effective end-to-end teams requires changes to processes, practices and culture, as well as flexible tooling that goes way beyond starting and configuring individual machines.

XebiaLabs’ solutions include open, integrated tooling all the way across development, QA and Operations, helping globally distributed teams build a shared, accurate picture of all the systems they are building and running. Replace handover moments with shared visibility and responsibility for the entire system lifecycle, and empower team members through simple self-service options.

Unlike other players hurriedly jumping onto the DevOps bandwagon, the XebiaLabs team has been an active participant in the DevOps community since the early stages. Benefit from our expertise in bringing DevOps to global organizations and work with a company that can help you sort DevOps reality from vendor make-believe.
